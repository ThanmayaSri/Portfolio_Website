										<h3>Detox Dial â€“ AI-Powered Digital Wellness App</h3>
										<p>Detox Dial is an AI-driven digital wellness application designed to help users overcome digital addiction through personalized AI interventions, behavioral analytics, and reinforcement learning-based habit formation. Unlike traditional app blockers, Detox Dial dynamically analyzes user behavior, tracks screen time, and provides AI-powered interventions via chatbots and phone calls. The system leverages GPT-based conversational AI to engage users in meaningful interactions, adapting its tone based on Briggs personality assessment results. The backend is built using Flask/Django with a PostgreSQL database, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of user engagement data. The React.js-based frontend delivers an interactive and intuitive experience, while AWS Lambda and Firebase provide cloud-based scalability and authentication. The system integrates machine learning models for predictive behavioral insights, allowing users to receive adaptive notifications that help in breaking addictive digital habits. This project highlights expertise in NLP, reinforcement learning, cloud computing, and AI-driven behavioral analytics.</p>

										<h3>Design & Implementation of Relational Database for Laptop Specifications</h3>
										<p>This project involves the design and implementation of a relational database system for managing and analyzing laptop specifications and customer reviews. The database is structured to support complex queries, data integrity constraints, and high-performance indexing for efficient retrieval. The schema adheres to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), ensuring minimal redundancy while maintaining referential integrity between tables such as Laptop, Brand, Processor, RAM, GPU, and Storage. The ETL pipeline, built using Apache Airflow and Pandas, processes and transforms raw laptop data from CSV files into a structured format. Advanced SQL queries, stored procedures, and indexing techniques (B-Tree, Hash) optimize data retrieval speed, while window functions and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) enable analytical querying. The database is integrated with Power BI and Tableau for real-time visualization, helping manufacturers, retailers, and analysts extract insights on market trends, customer sentiment, and feature popularity. This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL optimization, database normalization, and data pipeline automation.</p>

										<h3>Clustering of Cryptocurrency Price Movements</h3>
										<p>This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to analyze historical cryptocurrency price trends, segmenting assets into meaningful clusters for risk assessment and investment strategy development. The process begins with data acquisition and preprocessing, where historical price data from Kaggle datasets is cleaned and transformed using Python (Pandas, NumPy). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce dimensionality while retaining the most significant variance in the data. K-Means Clustering is then used to categorize cryptocurrencies based on market behavior, with the Elbow Method determining the optimal number of clusters. Additionally, Hierarchical Clustering is implemented to reveal the hierarchical relationships between assets. The final output is visualized using Shiny dashboards and Plotly, enabling users to dynamically explore trends and market segmentation. This project is particularly useful for investors, financial analysts, and researchers looking to understand cryptocurrency volatility and develop optimized portfolio strategies. It showcases expertise in data science, clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction, and interactive visualization.</p>
